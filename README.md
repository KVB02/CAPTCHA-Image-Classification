# CAPTCHA-Image-Classification
## Introduction:
This project tackles CAPTCHA image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed in Keras. We focused on preprocessing techniques, CNN architecture optimization, and performance evaluation to achieve high accuracy in decoding CAPTCHA images.

## Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language
Keras & TensorFlow: For building and training the CNN model
OpenCV & PIL: For image processing
Matplotlib: For plotting training/validation accuracy and loss
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation


## Installation:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CAPTCHA-Image-Classification.git
cd CAPTCHA-Image-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage:
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train the model and classify CAPTCHA images.

## Model Architecture:
The CNN model comprises multiple convolutional, batch normalization, dropout, and dense layers, trained to recognize and classify CAPTCHA characters with high accuracy.

## Results:
Our model achieved remarkable accuracy, demonstrating the potential of CNNs in CAPTCHA recognition tasks. Detailed accuracy and loss graphs are included to visualize the model's performance over training epochs.
